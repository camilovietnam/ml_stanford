# Stanford University's Machine Learning course
### Programming exercises
This is my repository for the answers to programming exercise in the Machine Learning course taught by Stanford University on the Coursera platform.
The exercises are written using the Octave tool. 
There are other repos like this one online, but it's always good to have one more source of information, in case those others disappear.

Unfortunately I only thought of creating this repo during week 3, so you won't find here the solutions for weeks 1 and 2.

**Disclaimer**: My intention with this repository is to help people who have trouble understanding the solutions, I'm not trying to help people cheat. You shouldn't copy the code directly from the repo, you should instead compare it against your version and try to find the differences, or use it to clarify that your results are different/equal.

In the end, it's up to you to be an honest person and try to learn as much as possible.
